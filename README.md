QuickStart
-----------------------

Just couple instructions to run boilerplate quickly :)

1. Make sure your Node match those in the package.json `engines` field (use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions)
1. Clone the repo and run `yarn` in the project root
1. Start the server with `yarn run start` and browse to `http://localhost:3000` to view the site.
1. Webpack will replace all changes done to app code so you won't need to refresh it manually


Scripts
-----------
Command | Notes
------- | -----
`start` | Starts the server in development mode on port `3000`
`prod` | (`yarn run build` first) Starts the server in production mode on port `9000`
`build` | Builds a production version into `build/` folder
`test` | Run unit tests using `jest`
